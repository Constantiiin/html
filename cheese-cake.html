    <p>
      Cheesecake is a dessert made with a soft fresh cheese (typically cottage
      cheese, cream cheese, quark or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. It may have a
      crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham
      crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.[1] Cheesecake may be baked or
      unbaked, and is usually served chilled. Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate,
      pumpkin, or other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer.
      Additional flavors and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished
      dessert with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate
      syrup, or other ingredients.
